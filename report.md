# Battleship game by Yangsoo Song / Kevin Sun

## Introduction and Game Description
For the project 1 of the cs4550 web development class, we created the battleship game that can be played by multi users. We followed the simliar steps that the class covered for Hangman game as the players of the  both games engage similarly. <br>
Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of the other's various ships.
The object of the game is to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. <br>
The game board each player gets has two grids. One of the grids is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the other grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their location on the grid. 
## UI Design
## UI to Server Protocol
## Data structures on server
## Implementation of game rules
## Challenges and Solutions
We had trouble finding the right data structures to implement our game as Elixir is not supposed to allow mutation of the variables which is different from the programming languages we worked on before taking this course.<br>
